r"""Fail on a control whose compliance tags are incomplete, duplicated, or non-literal.

Three defect classes, all of which have shipped from this fleet, and none of
which `cinc-auditor check` or `json` can see.

**A missing anchor is silent.** `tag nist:` is Rev 5; `tag nist_r4:` is the Rev 4
anchor a consumer joins to. A control with the first and not the second drops out
of a Rev 4 rollup and reads as absent coverage rather than as a control with no
Rev 4 predecessor. 47 controls across the fleet sat in that state, and they were
found by hand, control by control -- which is what this linter replaces.

Where a control genuinely has no Rev 4 predecessor -- `SR-3`, `CM-14`, `SC-45`
and the rest of what Rev 5 introduced -- it carries `tag nist_r4_unmapped:` with
the labels that have none. The claim is then explicit and reviewable in the
results, instead of being the absence of a line.

**A duplicated tag is noise that hides disagreement.** Nine controls in one
profile carried `tag ksi_unmapped:` twice, from a tagging pass that inserted
where it should have replaced. Ruby evaluates both, so nothing failed; a reader
still has to check whether the two copies agree.

**A non-literal tag value aborts the whole profile.** InSpec collects tags from
the AST at parse time and calls `.value` on the node:

    undefined method 'value' for an instance of RuboCop::AST::SendNode

`tag nist: SOME_CONSTANT` crashes `check`. Worse, `tag nist: [SOME_CONSTANT]`
passes both `check` AND `json` while emitting `[None]` -- a tag that looks
present and carries nothing.

Two things this linter must NOT flag, both of which the first version got wrong:

* **A tag set in each arm of a conditional.** `if mode == 'container_only'` ...
  `tag implementation_status: 'inherited'` ... `else` ... `'implemented'` ...
  `end` is one tag with two possible values, not a duplicate. Branches are
  tracked with a stack rather than a depth counter, for the same reason
  lint_resource_scope.py needs one: an `end` must pop the frame it belongs to.
* **A value carrying a comma, or continued across lines.** Splitting an array on
  every comma tears `"SRG V2R4 (audit domain, AWS-inherited)"` in half, and
  reading one line of a `"a: " \` / `"b"` continuation reads half a string.
